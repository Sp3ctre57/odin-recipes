<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        Gather all ingredients. <br>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br>
         Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.
        </li>
<li>
    Boil spaghetti in generously salted water until cooked through<br>
     but still firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
     Drain and set aside.
        </li>
    <li>
        While pasta cooks, stir cream cheese, sour cream, and<br>
         1 cup of mozzarella cheese together until combined; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
             Add beef in large chunks and cook,<br>
             undisturbed, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes
            </li>
             <li>
                Add onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook,<br> 
                breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon<br>
                 and stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through,<br>
                  about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and tilt the pan to pool<br>
                   grease onto one side, trying to keep the beef mixture on the other.<br>
                 Use a large spoon to remove grease; discard grease once cooled.
                </li>
       <li>
        Add marinara to beef mixture in skillet; stir until combined. Add reserved spaghetti.<br>
         Fold and stir until well coated in sauce.
        </li>
         <li>
            Transfer ½ of the pasta mixture to prepared baking dish.<br>
             Spread sour cream mixture evenly over pasta mixture in baking dish,<br>
             then top with remaining pasta mixture.
            </li>
             <li>
                Sprinkle remaining 1 cup mozzarella evenly over spaghetti mixture. <br>
                Cover loosely with aluminum foil and place baking dish on a baking sheet. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until cheese has melted,<br>
                 about 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and sprinkle<br>
                  top with Parmesan cheese.<br>
                 Increase oven temperature to broil. 
            </li>
            <l1>
             Broil until cheese has started to turn golden brown,<br>
              3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.   
            </l1>
